    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",

    "   \n",
    "    1. Doing Multiple Things at Once: Multithreading allows your program to do multiple things simultaneously.\n",
    "       It can make your program faster and more efficient by using the available resources better.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2.Responsive Program: With multithreading, your program can remain responsive even when it is doing time-consuming \n",
    "       tasks. It prevents the program from freezing or becoming unresponsive to user actions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3.Efficient Resource Usage: Multithreading helps make better use of your computer's resources, like the CPU and\n",
    "      memory. By running multiple threads at the same time, you can utilize the available processing power more effectively.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Faster Input/Output (I/O) Operations: Multithreading is useful for programs that involve reading from or writing to files,\n",
    "       network communication, or working with databases. While one thread is waiting for I/O to complete, other threads can continue \n",
    "        executing, making the overall process faster.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    5. Parallelism for Certain Tasks: Although there are limitations, multithreading can offer parallelism for certain tasks that don't\n",
    "      require the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This means tasks like mathematical computations or data processing can take advantage of \n",
    "     multiple CPU cores and run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Disadvantage of Multithreading :\n",
    "        \n",
    "    1.Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python has a limitation called the GIL that prevents true parallel execution of threads. \n",
    "      This means that even with multithreading, only one thread can execute Python code at a time. It limits the potential performance \n",
    "      gains of multithreading, especially for tasks that are CPU-bound.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Increased Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to your program. You need to carefully manage synchronization between threads \n",
    "       to avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks. Debugging and understanding multithreaded code can be more challenging due to the \n",
    "        potential for unexpected interactions between threads.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. Additional Overhead: Multithreading has some overhead due to the creation and management of threads, as well as the synchronization\n",
    "       mechanisms used to coordinate their execution. These additional tasks can impact performance and make the program slower.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4.Bugs and Difficult Debugging: Multithreading can introduce bugs that are difficult to reproduce and fix. Race conditions, where the \n",
    "      behavior of the program depends on the timing of thread execution, can be particularly challenging to identify and resolve.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    5. Limited Scalability: Because of the GIL, multithreading in Python may not scale as well as other languages or threading models that\n",
    "       allow true parallelism. If your program requires high scalability, alternative approaches like multiprocessing or asynchronous programming \n",
    "        might be more suitable.\n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Deadlock :\n",
    "       Deadlock refers to a situation where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for \n",
    "       the other to release a resource or complete a task. As a result, the threads end up in a circular wait, leading to a \n",

    "            \n",
    "    1.  Mutual Exclusion: Resources involved in the deadlock must be non-shareable, meaning only one thread can use a resource at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcefully taken away from threads holding them. They can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Circular Wait: A set of threads is waiting for resources in a circular manner, where one thread is waiting for a resource held\n",
    "       by another thread in the set.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      -  To resolve deadlocks, techniques like resource allocation strategies, careful ordering of resource acquisition, deadlock detection\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - Race conditions :\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Race conditions occur when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads accessing shared \n",
    "        resources or variables. It arises when two or more threads access a shared resource concurrently, and at least one thread modifies the\n",
    "        resource. The outcome of the program becomes unpredictable and can lead to incorrect results. Race conditions can happen due to the absence \n",
    "        of proper synchronization mechanisms in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "         - For example, consider two threads attempting to increment a shared variable count:\n",

    "            Thread 2: count = count + 1\n",

    "        If both threads execute simultaneously, they may read the same initial value of count, perform their computations,\n",

    "        \n",
    "      - To avoid race conditions, synchronization techniques like locks, mutexes, semaphores, or atomic operations are used to ensure exclusive\n",
